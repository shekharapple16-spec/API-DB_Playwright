# OpenAPI Specification for Scheduling Group API
#
# This is the single source of truth for the API contract. It defines all endpoints,
# request/response schemas, and validation rules for the scheduling group service.
#
# Purpose:
# - Defines API endpoints and their specifications
# - Serves as contract between frontend/backend/testers
# - Auto-generates TypeScript models and API clients
# - Enables consistent API documentation and validation
#
# Relationships:
# - Used by OpenAPI Generator to create TypeScript code in src/generated/
# - Referenced by API implementation (not in this repo)
# - Drives the structure of builders, clients, and tests
# - Should be updated when API changes are made
#
# Endpoints Defined:
# - POST /scheduling-groups: Create a new scheduling group
# - GET /scheduling-groups: Retrieve all scheduling groups
#
# Schemas:
# - SchedulingGroupRequest: Request payload for creating groups
# - SchedulingGroupResponse: Response payload with group data
#
# Generation Command:
# npm run generate:scheduling
